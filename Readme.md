This is a stand-alone Rmarkdown document offering a short observation on the relationship between electric fuel stations and zip code income. It was inspired by a [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenge. It uses the [alternative fuel stations database](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download) and two tables from the [U.S. Census data](https://data.census.gov/)--individual earnings (S2001) and family income (S1903) for the last 12 months, adjusted for inflation.
